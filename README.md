# Motor_Claw

This is Arduino code for a basic robot that uses a stepper motor for the jaw and a servo motor for the arm movement.  A DC motor is used in the project wiring, but does not function properly alongside the servo motor.  

##Controls: potControl is pot controlling the DC motor speed
	buttonPin is a button controlling the DC motor direction
	potControl2 is a pot controlling the stepper motor position
	potControl3 is a pot controlling the servo motor position


##Known Issues:

-This code will operate
